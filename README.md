# SnakeGame
Made my first game, Snake Game, following a tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding on youtube. Added a few modifications per my interests.

Modifications:
1. The original tutorial did not pay much heed to where the snake exaclty is with regards to one of the game over conditions: when it hits frame boundaries. I modified mine to be more accurate to the game I used to play as a child.
2. I also added a feature where the game can be restarted by pressing the enter key.
